Here's a very early version of the code that I pulled out of source
control, as I was just starting to implement the web interface.  I've
ripped out the Dominion parts and replaced them with a lame little
"game" that you can see in net.py under the comment "# here we would
start the game".

To set it up:

1. Download the closure library
   (http://code.google.com/closure/library/) and put it somewhere that
   it's served by your web server.

2. Change the first <script> tag in client.html to point to the copy
   of closure that you've installed on your machine.

3. Run "python3 net.py 2".  The "2" is the number of players.
   (There's no "lobby" in this code, it just starts a game as soon as
   that number of clients connect.)

4. Open two browser windows and point each to
   http://localhost:9999/client.html (or if your browser's on a different
   machine than you're running the game, the machine name instead of
   "localhost").  They should connect and play the "game".
